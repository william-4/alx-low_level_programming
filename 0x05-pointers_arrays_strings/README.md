# Day 1 of learning about pointers and strings in C
- Using the holberton betty style to write my code
- Using '_putchar', a custome 'putchar' function
- Currently not allowed to use the standard library

## The project tasks include:
- Task 0 - function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98
- Task 1 - a function that swaps the values of two integers
- Task 2 - a function that returns the length of a string
- Task 3 - a function that prints a string, followed by a new line to stdout
- Task 4 - a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line
- Task 5 - a function that reverses a string
- Task 6 - a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line
- Task 7 - a function that prints half of a string followed by a new line
- Task 8 - a functin that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line
- Task 9 - a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte(\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
- Task 10 - a function that converts a string to an integer
- Task 11 - a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme
